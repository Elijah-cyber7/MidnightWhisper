Code for co2 based rifle.
This is a rifle built around an arduino mini, it features two relays, two solenoid valves, two pressure sensors and one IC2 display. The later model only used one button to first prime the secondary tank and then actuate the solenoid that controls the QEV. More informatin can be found on my tiktok @Elijah.cyber
